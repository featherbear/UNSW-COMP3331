# What is the Internet

The internet is **not** a single network, rather it is an interconnection of many different computer networks

# Terminology

* Hosts - End systems
* Communication Links - Fiber, Copper, Radio, Satellite
* Transmission Rate - Bandwidth
* Packet Switches - Routers, Switches
* Protocols - Communication rules
* Internet Standards - Interoperability
  * RFC - Request For Comments
  * IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force

# Network Edge

End systems, access networks, links

# Network Core

Packet switching, circuit switching, network structure

--

* DSL - Symmetric upstream and downstream (Given a fixed bandwith, upstream and downstream rates are same)
* ADSL - Asymmetric upstream and downstrea (Given a fixed bandwidth, more focus on the downstream)
* Coaxial Cable
* NBN - HAH.

# Physical media (not assessable)

* bit
* physical link
* guided media - signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, coax
* unguided media - signal propagate freely, radio
